# Code Review Guide

We review code so the next person can read it. A change is good when a
teammate can open the file, follow the logic top to bottom, and understand why
it is correct without chasing it across the codebase. This guide is what we
look for, in Swift (`apps/Donkey`) and TypeScript (`site`) alike.

**The one rule:** every change must reduce the total complexity a reader holds
in their head. Adding code that does this is progress. Adding code that hides
complexity behind more moving parts is not, even when each piece looks small.

## Function Depth

A function earns its name by hiding real work behind a simple interface. A
deep function takes a small, obvious input and saves the caller from a lot of
detail. A shallow function adds a name and a call frame but hides almost
nothing.

- Do not wrap a single call or a one-line expression in a new function just to
  give it a name. Inline it; the reader can see what it does.
- Do not split a coherent piece of logic into a chain of tiny helpers that each
  do one trivial step. Following the chain costs more than reading the whole.
- Do split when a block has a genuine, nameable responsibility with a narrow
  interface, when it is reused, or when the detail it hides is real.
- Judge an interface by how much it lets the caller forget, not by line count.

When you are tempted to extract, ask: does the caller become simpler to read,
or does it just gain another name to follow? Extract only for the former.

## Indirection

Every layer the reader must step through to find the real behavior is a tax.
Pay it only when it buys something.

- Prefer a direct call to a ladder of pass-through wrappers, adapters, and
  re-exports that only forward arguments.
- Do not add an interface, protocol, or injection seam for a single
  implementation that has no second caller and no test that needs to fake it.
- Avoid barrel/`index.ts` re-exports and broad protocol indirection that exist
  only to look layered. Import the concrete thing directly.
- A reader should reach the code that does the work in one or two hops, not
  five.

Indirection that maps to a real boundary is good: the Swift MVC split
(`docs/guides/swift-mvc.md`) exists for a reason. The tax is forwarding
layers that exist for their own sake.

## Design Simplicity

- Solve the problem in front of you. Do not add configuration, generality, or
  extension points for a future that has not arrived.
- Remove derivable or duplicated state. If a value can be computed from
  another, compute it; do not store and sync two copies.
- Collapse special cases into the shared mechanism instead of bolting another
  branch onto it. A growing pile of special cases means the underlying design
  needs to change, not that it needs one more `if`.
- Build forward. Update callers to the new shape rather than keeping
  compatibility shims and dead branches. Ask before keeping a shim.
- Delete code the change makes unreachable. Do not leave it commented out.

## Readability

- Names carry the meaning. A reader who knows only the name should guess the
  behavior. Rename before you comment around a confusing name.
- Comments explain *why* — the constraint, the edge case, the reason this is
  not the obvious approach. Do not narrate *what* the code already says.
- Keep nesting shallow. Return early, handle the error case first, and let the
  main path run down the left margin.
- Keep the happy path obvious and the rare path out of its way.
- Match the surrounding code's idiom, naming, and comment density. A change
  that reads like the file around it is easier to trust.

## Repo-Specific Rules

1. **Never match raw user text for intent.** No phrase lists, prefixes,
   suffixes, regexes, app-name checks, or greeting/help classifiers. Route the
   turn through an LLM or a typed model boundary, then match on structured
   output only.
2. **Keep the Swift MVC boundaries intact.** Views render and emit intents,
   models own state, controllers own AppKit. See `docs/guides/swift-mvc.md`.
3. **Follow the site guides.** For `site` UI,
   `docs/guides/frontend-nextjs-guidelines.md`: server components by default,
   no `fetch` from components, no `any`. For database work,
   `docs/guides/backend-apis.md`: no hand-written SQL migrations, no
   `prisma migrate` or `prisma db push`, and Prisma models in grouped sibling
   `.prisma` files, never in `schema.prisma`.
4. **Confirm the required checks ran.** `npm run lint` and `npm run build` for
   `site` changes; focused `swift test` runs for Mac app changes.
5. **Never commit secrets, keys, tokens, or PII.** This repo is open source.
