# Frontend and Next.js Guidelines

How to work in the `site` Next.js app: route structure, server/client
boundaries, Tailwind styling, and data access.

**The one rule:** React components never call `fetch(...)` directly.
Client-side data access goes through TanStack Query hooks in `src/queries/`;
server-side data access stays in server code. If you're tempted to fetch
inline, the call belongs in a hook.

## Project Shape

- Routes, layouts, pages, loading states, and route handlers live in
  `src/app`.
- Shared UI primitives live in `src/components`; route-specific UI stays near
  the route, such as `src/app/_components/landing` for the home page.
- Server-only helpers live in `src/lib`.
- Split large route experiences into focused component files.
- Use absolute imports through the `@/*` alias; avoid barrel `index.ts` files
  unless a package-level public API truly needs one.

## Components

- Components are Server Components by default. Add `"use client"` only for
  state, effects, refs, event handlers, browser APIs, or client-only hooks.
- Keep client boundaries small and close to the interactive control.
- Keep secrets and direct database access out of Client Components.
- Pass plain serializable props from Server Components into Client Components.

## Navigation

- Use the `next/link` `<Link>` component for internal routes (anything
  starting with `/`) so navigation stays client-side and prefetches. Use a
  plain `<a>` only for external URLs, `mailto:`, and other non-route links.
- When a shared control accepts an arbitrary `href` (such as the landing
  `PillButton`), let the control pick `<Link>` vs `<a>` from the href instead
  of duplicating that choice at every call site.

## Styling

- Tailwind utility classes are the default for all UI, with no exceptions by
  area. Do not write React inline `style` objects for layout, spacing,
  typography, colors, borders, or responsive behavior. Reserve inline `style`
  strictly for genuinely runtime values: a dimension computed from props or
  state, CSS custom properties derived from data, or a third-party style API.
- Tailwind is configured via CSS (`@theme` in `src/app/globals.css`), not a
  `tailwind.config.*` file; its absence is not a reason to use inline styles.
- When a style genuinely exceeds utilities — a custom `@keyframes` animation, a
  layered `box-shadow` — put it in a plain `.css` file beside the feature and
  pull it into the bundle with a side-effect import (`import "./thing.css"`)
  from the module that owns the class. Reserve `globals.css` for base and theme
  styles; feature CSS lives with its feature. Apply the class through the normal
  `className`, composing with utilities via `cn`.
- Use the brand tokens defined in `globals.css` rather than repeating raw hex:
  `text-ink`/`bg-ink`/`border-ink` (near-black), `bg-coral`/`text-coral`,
  `bg-cream`, `bg-background` (page sand), and `font-system`/`font-code`.
  Reach for a Tailwind arbitrary value (`text-[#454545]`,
  `text-[clamp(45px,9.6vw,134px)]`) only for genuinely one-off values not
  worth a token.
- Use Tailwind responsive variants for breakpoints (`md:*`, and arbitrary
  variants like `min-[900px]:*` for a non-standard breakpoint). Do not add
  client-only media-query hooks to choose styling. When an element only
  differs by visibility, toggle it with `hidden`/`md:block` rather than
  conditional rendering.
- Compose conditional classes with the `cn` helper from `@/lib/utils`.
- Prefer existing icon components for buttons and compact actions when an icon
  fits the control.
- Keep controls at stable dimensions so hover states, icons, labels, and
  loading states do not shift layout.
- Keep cards for repeated items, modals, and genuinely framed content. Avoid
  nesting cards inside cards.

## Data and APIs

- Route Handlers live in `src/app/api/**/route.ts` and follow
  `docs/guides/backend-apis.md` — authenticated by default, Zod-validated,
  explicit responses.
- Every query/mutation hook lives in `src/queries/` so the cache surface is
  auditable in one place. Components import the hooks; they do not fetch
  inline. The shared fetch wrapper and error type are
  `src/queries/apiClient.ts`. Define each query's key as a constant alongside
  its hook in the same module (export it if another module needs to invalidate
  it). Mount `QueryProvider` once at the root layout.
- Per-user account views (`/app/settings`, including API keys and usage) are
  client-rendered and read their data through these hooks. The route handlers
  still enforce auth server-side, so a client guard is for UX, not security.
- Use database clients only from server-side code, and never run migrations or
  schema pushes casually; choose the migration workflow deliberately for the
  target database.

## TypeScript

- Use `type` for props and local data shapes; prefer a short `Props` name when
  there is only one props type in the file.
- Do not use `any`; define the narrowest useful type or stop and clarify.
- Prefer optional chaining (`a?.b`) over `a && a.b` or `!a || !a.b` when
  reading a possibly-absent member.
- Keep imports direct and explicit.
- Include real dependencies in hooks; store callbacks in refs when they should
  not trigger re-renders.

## Checks

- Do not commit `.env` or secrets.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run build` before shipping frontend changes.
