// Renders the hosted voice-persona assets the Cut voice picker shows: one
// square portrait and one spoken sample clip per prebuilt speech voice. Both are
// produced with the same Vertex models the app uses — gemini-2.5-flash-image for
// the portrait, the Gemini TTS model for the sample — and written into
// public/cut/voices as <id>.webp and <id>.mp3 (lowercased ids, matching
// voicePortraitUrl / voiceSampleUrl). Idempotent: a voice whose portrait and
// sample already exist is skipped, so re-running fills gaps or picks up voices
// added to the catalog only.
