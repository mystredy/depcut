 * Each pixel is judged against the backdrop colour beside it, carried along by
 * the fill, so a backdrop that drifts across the frame stays backdrop the whole
 * way. An image generator paints a "solid" sweep with a gradient and a little
 * noise in it, and one global colour would call the far corner a subject.
 * Drifting is bounded: a pixel far enough from the border colour is a subject
 * however smoothly it was reached, so a soft shadow cannot leak into the cat.
