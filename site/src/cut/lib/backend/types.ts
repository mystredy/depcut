// A Cut backend is where a project lives and executes: "local" is the engine

// deployment (session auth, Postgres + R2), and "shared" is a read-only view
// of another account's cloud project through a share link. All speak the same
// JSON route shapes, so ordinary API calls dispatch through one transport;
// operations whose contracts genuinely differ (uploads, export,
// transcription) branch on the backend kind where they are implemented.
