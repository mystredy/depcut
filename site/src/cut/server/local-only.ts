// Cut is a local-only product. Its server APIs run on the user's own Mac —
// against their local ffmpeg/swiftc, their own claude/codex CLI logins, and
// local disk. They must never execute on hosted infrastructure, both because
// the tools and files aren't there and because those routes are unauthenticated
// by design (fine on localhost, an exposure on a public host).
//
// On a hosted deploy, donkeycut.com still serves Cut's client bundle, but
// every server API is switched off — so nothing reads local disk, spawns a
// process, or reaches any model, including our production models. Cut's AI only
// ever uses the user's local claude/codex logins; it has no path to hosted
// inference, and this guard keeps it that way.
//
// `VERCEL` is set on every Vercel build and runtime and is absent when running
// locally, so this guard is inert during local dev and a local `npm run start`,
// and only trips on a real deploy.
