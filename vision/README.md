# Vision RunPod Serverless Worker

A [RunPod Serverless](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/overview) worker that
wraps Microsoft [OmniParser V2](https://github.com/microsoft/OmniParser) — YOLO
icon detection + OCR + Florence-2 captioning — and parses a screenshot into
labeled UI regions.

The worker returns the model's **raw** output. Normalization into Donkey's
screenshot-parser contract lives in the site adapter
(`site/src/lib/inference/screenshot-parsing/vision.ts`), not here. The site
serves it on its own route, `POST /api/inference/vision`, separate from the
gemini-flash parser at `/api/inference/screenshots/parse`.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `handler.py` | RunPod handler: base64 image in, raw model output out |
| `Dockerfile` | Builds the worker image; bakes V2 weights in at build time |
| `requirements-worker.txt` | Worker-only deps (`runpod`, `huggingface_hub`) |
| `test_input.json` | Sample payload for local handler testing |

## Request / response contract

Request `input`:

```jsonc
{
  "image": "<base64 screenshot, no data: prefix>",
  "box_threshold": 0.05,   // optional
  "iou_threshold": 0.1,    // optional
  "imgsz": 640             // optional
}
```

Response:

```jsonc
{
  "labeled_image_base64": "<base64 PNG with boxes drawn>",
  "label_coordinates": { "0": [x, y, w, h], ... },   // ratio space (0-1)
  "parsed_content_list": [
    {
      "type": "text" | "icon",
      "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],   // ratio space (0-1), NOT pixels
      "interactivity": true,
      "content": "Sign in",
      "source": "box_ocr_content_ocr"   // present for OCR text elements
    }
  ]
}
```

Boxes are image-size-independent ratios. To get Donkey's
`box_2d = [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]` in 0-1000 space, multiply by 1000 and
reorder: `[y1*1000, x1*1000, y2*1000, x2*1000]` (the site adapter does this).

## Deploy via RunPod GitHub integration

RunPod builds and hosts the image directly from this repo — no Docker Hub push.

1. RunPod console → **Settings → Connections → GitHub → Connect** and authorize
   access to this repository.
2. **Serverless → New Endpoint → Import Git Repository** → select this repo.
3. Set:
   - **Branch**: `main` (RunPod rebuilds on every push to it)
   - **Dockerfile Path**: `vision/Dockerfile`
4. Pick a GPU (RTX 4090 / A40 / L40S is a good start).
5. **Active workers = 0** for cheap testing (cold starts apply) or `1` for low
   latency. Set sensible execution/idle timeouts.
6. Deploy. Note the **Endpoint ID** — the site adapter needs it.

See RunPod's [GitHub deployment docs](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/github-integration).

## Local handler test

You don't need a GPU to exercise the handler shape (CPU works, just slow).

```bash
# Put a real screenshot's base64 into test_input.json (replace the placeholder).
base64 -i screenshot.png | tr -d '\n'    # macOS: copy into "image"

# Inside the built image (or a venv with OmniParser + its requirements):
python handler.py            # RunPod SDK auto-runs ./test_input.json
```

Confirm `parsed_content_list` is non-empty and each `bbox` is four values in
0-1. Build the image for local runs with:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t vision-worker:dev vision/
```

## Calling the deployed endpoint

```bash
curl -s -X POST \
  "https://api.runpod.ai/v2/${RUNPOD_VISION_ENDPOINT_ID}/runsync" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${RUNPOD_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input":{"image":"<base64>","box_threshold":0.05,"iou_threshold":0.1,"imgsz":640}}'
```

## Licensing

OmniParser's `icon_detect` (YOLO) weights are **AGPL-3.0**; `icon_caption`
(Florence-2) is **MIT**. This worker bakes both into the image. Keep that in
mind before redistributing the built image — it carries AGPL-3.0 weights.

## Latency note

Serverless inference with zero active workers has real cold-start cost. Treat
it as a fallback/evaluation parser; for low-latency UX run with active
workers ≥ 1 or a persistent pod.
