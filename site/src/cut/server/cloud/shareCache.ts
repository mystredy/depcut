// A share link is at its most useful in the window the owner has stopped
// editing: they paste it somewhere and a crowd opens the same token at once.
// So the cache lifetime tracks how long the project has been still — a doc
// saved seconds ago is served near-live, one untouched for an hour is served
// from the edge for minutes. `stale-while-revalidate` keeps every viewer off
// the origin path either way: the edge answers immediately and refreshes
// behind the request.
//
// Only public shares are cacheable. A restricted share's response depends on
// the viewer's session cookie, so it must never land in a shared cache entry.
