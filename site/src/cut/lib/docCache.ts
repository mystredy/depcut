/**
 * A project's own snapshots: the document the editor opens with, and the
 * signed links that make its media playable.
 *
 * Opening a cloud project is two round trips before a frame can be drawn —
 * fetch the doc, then mint a batch of R2 URLs for its files. Both answers are
 * things this browser already had the last time it held the project, so both
 * are kept on disk and painted immediately while the real ones are fetched.
 *
 * The document snapshot is also the editor's crash ledger: every edit rewrites
 * it marked dirty, alongside the version it was edited on top of, and a
 * successful save rewrites it clean. A snapshot that is clean is a head start
 * and never the truth — the live document lands and replaces it. A snapshot
 * that is dirty is unsaved work: the open resumes it and pushes it up, unless
 * the server has moved past its base version, in which case the server wins
 * like any conflict.
