 * Rendering the cut to a file, in the browser.

 * The tab already knows how to draw this project — it does it sixty times a
 * second in the preview. The only things it was missing were a clock it could
 * step rather than follow, and somewhere to put the frames. This supplies both:
 * frames are pulled at exact timestamps instead of played towards, and the
 * finished picture goes into an MP4 muxer instead of onto the screen.
 *
 * Everything about what a frame looks like comes from the same two modules the
 * preview uses — `framePlan` for what is on screen at a given moment, and
 * `FrameCompositor` for turning that into pixels. Nothing here decides how the
 * cut should look. That is the point: a render is the preview, evaluated at
 * every frame instead of at whatever moment the display asked for.
