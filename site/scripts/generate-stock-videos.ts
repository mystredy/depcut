//   cd site && ./node_modules/.bin/bun scripts/generate-stock-videos.ts

// Needs GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON (bun auto-loads site/.env) and
// ffmpeg on PATH for the poster thumbs. Each clip renders at 720p, lands as an
// mp4 under public/cut-stock-video, and gets a first-frame WebP thumb the
// browse grid uses.
//
// After generation, every clip is tagged: a vision pass looks at the poster
// frame and extracts the searchable keywords (objects, animals, setting) the
// editor's search box matches. Tags already in the manifest are reused, so
// re-running only tags new or untagged clips.
