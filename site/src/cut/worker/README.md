# Cut cloud render worker

A Linux container that executes Cut web mode's background jobs — `export`,
`preview` (hover proxy), `card` (a shared link's preview image), and
`import_url` — by polling the `cut_render_job`
table and running the same pipeline code the local engine uses
(`../server/exportPipeline.ts`, `../server/urlDownload.ts`). Media moves
through Cloudflare R2; ffmpeg/ffprobe/yt-dlp come from the container image's
PATH.

## Build

```sh
npm run worker:build                                      # bundles to dist/cut-worker/main.js
docker build -f src/cut/worker/Dockerfile -t donkey-cut-worker .   # from site/
```

## Run

```sh
docker run -d \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgres://… \
  -e R2_ACCOUNT_ID=… \
  -e R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=… \
  -e R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=… \
  donkey-cut-worker
```

Required env (secrets only — everything else is code constants):

- `DATABASE_URL` — the same Postgres the hosted site uses.
- `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` — R2 credentials
  for the `donkey-cut` bucket.

One replica is enough to start: it runs up to 2 jobs concurrently (the
engine's cap). Replicas can be added later without coordination — the atomic
row claim keeps them from double-running a job, and SIGTERM requeues whatever
a replica had in flight.

## Deploy (Cloudflare Containers)

The worker ships as a Cloudflare Container: `cf/worker.ts` is the Worker
shell, `wrangler.jsonc` the deployment config (1 instance, 2 vCPU / 4 GiB /
10 GB disk). The container runs on demand, not always-on: the hosted API
POSTs the Worker's `/wake` endpoint (bearer `CUT_WAKE_SECRET`) whenever it
queues a job and again on every poll of a still-queued job, so a lost wake
self-heals; `main.ts` exits after ~60s of empty queue so the container stops
billing. Cold start is a few seconds. The hosted deployment needs
`CUT_RENDER_WAKE_SECRET` in its env to send wakes — without it, queued jobs
wait for a manually run worker. The address is code, not config: the Worker
claims `worker.donkeycut.com` as its own custom domain, named in
`src/cut/lib/hosts.ts`. That is deliberate — the wake used to ride the
workers.dev address, and declaring the media route made wrangler turn
workers.dev off, stranding every render with nothing to see but queued jobs.

GitHub Actions deploys automatically on push to `main` when the worker or the
shared pipeline code changes (`.github/workflows/deploy-cut-worker.yml`).
One-time setup:

1. Cloudflare Workers Paid plan (Containers requires it).
2. A Cloudflare API token with the "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template plus
   Containers permissions → repo secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and
   `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`.
3. After the first deploy, set the Worker's secrets once (from `site/`):
   `npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL -c src/cut/worker/wrangler.jsonc`
   and the same for `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
   `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `CUT_WAKE_SECRET` (any long random string).
   Use the Supabase connection-pooler URL for `DATABASE_URL`.
4. On the hosted site (Vercel env): `CUT_RENDER_WAKE_SECRET` = the same random
   string.

Manual deploy from `site/`:

```sh
npm run worker:build && npx wrangler deploy -c src/cut/worker/wrangler.jsonc
```

## Shared media at the edge

The Worker also serves a shared project's media (`cf/media.ts`), on its own
hostname and its own R2 binding — the bucket stays private, so this handler is
the only way in. The hosted API mints a short HMAC token per URL; the Worker
checks it, then serves the object from Cloudflare's cache **keyed on the object
path alone**, with the token dropped. That is what lets the token be short:
every viewer and every re-mint share one cached copy instead of missing per
URL.

Two properties fall out of it. Unsharing takes effect within a token's life
(five minutes) rather than the day a presigned R2 URL would keep working. And
media is served from the edge instead of R2's S3 endpoint, which Cloudflare
does not cache at all.

Range requests are served from the cached object (Cloudflare answers `206` from
a stored `200`); a miss streams the asked-for bytes from R2 and warms the full
object in the background. Objects past Cloudflare's 512 MB cacheable ceiling
stream straight through, uncached.

One-time setup:

1. The zone must be on Cloudflare — the Cache API is a no-op on `workers.dev`,
   so the route has to be a real hostname. `wrangler.jsonc` claims
   `media.donkeycut.com` as a custom domain and wrangler creates the DNS record
   and certificate on deploy; a pre-existing CNAME on that name blocks it. The
   handler matches `CUT_MEDIA_HOST` in `../lib/hosts.ts`, so the two names move
   together.
2. Generate the secret once: `openssl rand -hex 32`.
3. Worker secret: `npx wrangler secret put CUT_MEDIA_SIGNING_SECRET -c
   src/cut/worker/wrangler.jsonc`, pasting that value.
4. On the hosted site (Vercel env): `CUT_MEDIA_SIGNING_SECRET`, the same value.
   Holding it is what switches the feature on.

The two sides must carry the same string — a mismatch fails every request's
signature check. Without the site variable the hosted API presigns R2 exactly
as before, so local dev and an un-migrated deployment both keep working.

## Copy queue

The Worker is also the consumer of the `donkey-cut-copy` Cloudflare Queue:
project copies — a viewer copying a share, or an owner duplicating a cloud
project from the dashboard — enqueue a `CutCopyJob` id, and the consumer
POSTs each id back to the hosted `/api/cut-copy-worker` endpoint one message
at a time (`max_batch_size` and `max_concurrency` are both 1), so copies
drain serially instead of stampeding R2. One-time setup:

1. Create the queue (from `site/`): `npx wrangler queues create donkey-cut-copy`.
2. Worker secrets: `CUT_COPY_EXECUTE_URL` (the hosted endpoint, e.g.
   `https://donkeycut.com/api/cut-copy-worker`) and `CUT_COPY_EXECUTE_SECRET`
   (any long random string).
3. On the hosted site (Vercel env): `CLOUDFLARE_QUEUES_API_TOKEN` (an API
   token with Queues edit on the account — publishes ride the REST API since
   the site isn't a Worker) and the same `CUT_COPY_EXECUTE_SECRET`.

Without the queue env, the hosted API runs copies inline in the request —
fine for local dev, unthrottled in production.

## Share streaming (HLS ladder)

A shared project plays as an adaptive stream rather than a file, so an `hls`
job renders the cut and packages it into a rung ladder under
`cut/<user>/projects/<id>/hls/<version>/` in R2. Segments are served by the
media handler above, through a token that covers the whole tree — see
`../server/hlsLadder.ts` for why a single mp4 is the wrong shape here.

What a project has published is recorded in **Workers KV**, not Postgres: it is
derived state, and losing it costs a re-render and nothing else. Neither writer
is a Worker (the site runs on Vercel, this render worker is a container), so
both use the KV REST API.

The record is more than a pointer, because it is the only index these trees
have. A version is claimed there *before* its first byte uploads, so a render
killed partway still leaves something the sweep can find; a published version
displaces the previous one into a retired list stamped with the moment it was
replaced, which is the clock its day of grace runs on. Only records carrying
retired or pending versions are listed at all, so the nightly sweep does work
proportional to the garbage rather than to how many projects exist.

The only setup is the credential — `CLOUDFLARE_KV_API_TOKEN`, scoped to
Workers KV read+write on the account in `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, held both by the
hosted site and as a Worker secret (`cf/worker.ts` passes it into the
container). The namespace itself is created on first write and then found by
title, so there is nothing to provision and no id to paste into
`wrangler.jsonc`; the title lives in `../server/cloud/ladderStore.ts`.

It is required, not optional, and its absence is loud where an operator will
see it: a ladder render that cannot record where it landed fails its job with
the reason on the row, and the stream route logs and answers 5xx rather than
reporting "no ladder". What a viewer sees is separate — they fall back to the
project's flattened preview proxy, because a broken deployment is not theirs to
diagnose and a spinner helps nobody. The two are deliberately not the same
signal: `readLadder` returning null means one thing only, that no ladder exists
yet, and it never doubles as "something is broken".

Ladders never count against a user's storage quota — they carry no media rows
and are found and swept by prefix, the same way inference scratch is.
