// Cut's client reaches its engine two ways. Served locally (cut.localhost,
// localhost) the page and the engine share an origin, so paths stay relative.
// Served from the hosted domain (donkeycut.com) the page is just static
// html/js — the Cut APIs are switched off on that host — so every API call
// targets the engine running on this Mac instead. Loopback is a trustworthy
// origin, so the https page may call it; the engine grants the hosted origin
// CORS (see src/proxy.ts).
//
// The mapping is fixed, with no fallback. A hosted page reaches exactly one
// engine — the release app's, on its loopback port — by health-probing that
// single origin; it never tries another port. A local page stays same-origin,
// so its own dev server answers in-process. A dev Donkey app runs its engine on
// its own port (DonkeyCutEnginePort) for that local surface, never reached from
// the hosted page. The resolved origin is remembered for the session.
