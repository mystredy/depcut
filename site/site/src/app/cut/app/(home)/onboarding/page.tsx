// The welcome sequence's own address. The sequence is a full-window overlay
// mounted in the app shell that reads this address itself and opens from its
// first paint, so this route only renders what's underneath it. A signup lands
// here, and a new account arrives with its seeded starter project — so under
// the slides this route moves to that project's editor, and closing the last
// slide hands over to a cut ready to explore. An account without a starter
// (seed failed, or an older account revisiting this address) stays on the app
// home, the same thing that's behind the sequence everywhere else.
