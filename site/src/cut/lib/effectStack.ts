/**
 * Where effects stand in the element stack.
 *
 * Lane 0 is the top row and a bigger lane number sits further under it, so an
 * effect grades the lanes below its own and leaves the ones above alone. The
 * stage is therefore built in slices, bottom to top: the picture, the elements
 * under the deepest effect, that effect's paints, the elements above it, and
 * so on up. A slice wears the grade of every effect above it as a plain CSS
 * filter and their frame moves as a transform.
 *
 * The math is here, apart from React, because both exports walk the same stack.
