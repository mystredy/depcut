/**
 * Model-agnostic capability roles.
 *
 * The pipeline never names a provider. It asks for a capability by role —
 * "write the script", "generate a video", "sync lips to this audio" — and a
 * `ModelSuite` binds each role to some adapter. Provider names live only inside
 * those adapters (see `registry.ts`); swapping models is swapping which adapter
 * a role resolves to, and evals compare suites that differ by one role. The
 * orchestrator depends on this interface and nothing else model-facing.
