// bottom; the title stays pinned by being sticky inside it. Pages still pick
// their behavior: billing overflows and scrolls the pane, usage fills the
// remaining height exactly (flex-1 + h-full chain) and scrolls only its table
// body. p-px gives the cards' outside ring a pixel of room so the scroll
// container can't clip their top border.
