// saw there, and the banner rises when one of those projects is open: that is
// the moment something is actually blocked, and the banner opens the recovery
// steps in a dialog. The gate keeps probing behind it, so starting the Donkey
// app clears the banner and the project loads. Engine loss mid-session
// (api.ts's engineLost) lands in the same state.
