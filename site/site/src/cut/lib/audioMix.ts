/**
 * The cut's audible mix, rendered in the browser.
 *
 * One `OfflineAudioContext` fold that mirrors the engine's ffmpeg audio graph:
 * track-0 clip audio folds sequentially with cross-dissolves overlapping,
 * upper-track clips and soundtrack items land at their absolute starts with
 * their own volumes and fades, a ducking voiceover pulls everything else down
 * while it speaks, and the whole-project fade rides over the sum.
 *
 * Two callers want this and want it at different shapes. Transcription needs a
 * 16 kHz mono buffer, because that is what a speech model reads; an export
 * needs full-rate stereo, because that is what goes in the file. Same fold,
 * different rate and channel count — which is why those are parameters and the
 * fold is written once. A mix that drifted between them would put captions on
 * words that the exported audio says at another time.
