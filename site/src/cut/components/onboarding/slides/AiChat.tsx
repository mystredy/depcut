// The one slide that uses the whole window rather than the sequence's reading
// column. The editor is the layout — the slide is exactly as tall as the mock,
// so there's no dead band above or below it — and the copy is laid over its
// left side. Two things keep that legible, and both are needed: the mock's own
// left half dissolves into the cream, and a cream scrim under the copy holds
// the contrast wherever the mock's edge lands at a given window size.
