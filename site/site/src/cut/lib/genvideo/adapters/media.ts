/**
 * The media roles — image, video, voice — over the exact browser-side
 * generation the panels and chat already use (`useGenerate`, `tts`). Each runs
 * on the user's Donkey session and credits and lands its output as a real
 * project asset, so what these return is a placeable asset id and the editor
 * bridge's `importMedia` has nothing left to do.
 *
 * Two shaping choices matter for the assembled cut:
 * - Video is NOT audio-native here: the model renders each shot's audio itself
 *   from the prompt (which states the shot's line), and there is no way to feed
 *   it our own track. In a generated scene that burned-in narration is the point
 *   — the orchestrator places the clip unmuted and lays no separate voice track.
 *   In a provided-audio scene the user's audio is the spine, so the orchestrator
 *   mutes the clip's own audio instead.
 * - Cast identity is anchored per shot, strongest signal first (see the ladder
 *   in shotAttempts.ts): the shot's keyframe — already rendered with the cast's
 *   reference images, so it IS the cast — seeds the render as its literal
 *   opening frame; if the anchor is blocked, the character/location reference
 *   images condition a reference-to-video render; text-only is the last
 *   resort — for a cast shot it runs only when the provider refused the image
 *   anchor itself, and its take still faces the reviewer's identity gate
 *   before placing. Each rung's prompt folds in the bible descriptions of
 *   exactly the cast that doesn't ride that call as an image
 *   (describeUnanchored), so the text-only rung renders against the full
 *   written identity — the same fixed words every shot — instead of a bare
 *   action line.
 * - The model picks each clip's length (up to ~10s) — there is no duration
 *   knob — and always covers the shot's slot, so the editor trims the take to
 *   the exact shot.
