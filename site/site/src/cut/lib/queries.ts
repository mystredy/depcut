 * The home surfaces' data layer: the projects listing per residency and the

 *
 * Both are read on every visit and change rarely, so they are cached twice
 * over. TanStack Query holds them for the life of the tab, which is what makes
 * project → back → project instant; a snapshot in IndexedDB carries the last
 * answer across reloads, so even a cold load paints the shelf it painted last
 * time. Neither is ever waited on: the live request goes out regardless and
 * replaces whatever was showing.
 *
 * Mutations edit the cached lists in place through the patch helpers rather
 * than refetching, so a rename or a move lands on screen in the same frame the
 * user asked for it.
