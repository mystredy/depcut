// The chat harness's understanding boundary for one composer turn: a fast
// structured model call judges the newest user message — does it ask for
// anything, and how big is the job — and the harness gates and routes
// deterministically on the verdict. A "chat" turn (greeting, thanks — social
// filler that requests nothing) runs with no tool declarations at all, so
// unsolicited edits are impossible by construction. A "simple" turn (one
// self-contained ask) runs on the light chat model; a "complex" turn (a
// composed job) runs on the full model. The turn runner overlaps this call
// with the first model round and holds tool execution until the verdict
// lands, so the gate costs a simple turn no wall time.

Reply with exactly one word:
chat — pure social filler (a greeting, thanks, a sign-off, an acknowledgement) that requests nothing.
simple — one self-contained ask: a single edit, a single generation, or a question to answer. Terse follow-ups ("yes", "do it", "the second one") that confirm one pending action are simple.
complex — a composed job: several edits across the timeline, cutting or reorganizing many clips, assembling media into a cut, or anything needing a plan across steps. A sweep phrased as one ask still fans out into many cuts — removing filler words, tightening silences, cutting every pause — and is complex. An edit aimed at "this clip / that one / it" with no named target is also complex — resolving the referent takes the full model. So is an edit whose targets are picked by description — "the grey ones", "the short clips" — since deciding which items match takes the full model.

If unsure between chat and the others, reply simple. If unsure between simple and complex, reply complex.`;
