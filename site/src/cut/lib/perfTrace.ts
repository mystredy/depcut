 * What the preview actually did, frame by frame.

 * can be settled by watching. This records the two facts that settle them: when
 * a time was asked for, and when a frame for that time reached the screen. From
 * those, "the picture is one frame behind the pointer" and "the join dropped a
 * frame" become numbers a script can hold to a budget.
 *
 * The trace is off until something arms it, and while it is off every call here
 * is a null check. The eval arms it through `window.__cutPerf`; nothing in the
 * product turns it on.
