// The whole Cut API lives under /api/cut/* and routes through the shared table
// (src/cut/server/http/routes.ts) — the same one the packaged engine mounts.
//
// Cut is local-only: on a hosted deploy every Cut API 404s. The 404 is returned
// here, before the dynamic import that pulls the router, so the engine never
// runs on hosted. Turbopack still *traces* that import, though, and the engine's
// module graph reaches cwd-rooted file operations it can't statically scope — so
// on hosted builds next.config aliases "@/cut/server/http/next" to a 404 stub,
// keeping the engine (and the ~220MB SDK CLI binary it would otherwise sweep in)
// out of the deployed function so it fits Vercel's size limit.
