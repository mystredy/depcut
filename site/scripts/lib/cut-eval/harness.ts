/**
 * The eval runner: one case = one chat turn through the PRODUCTION loop —
 * streamCutChat, the pi-based turn runner the editor itself uses — with the
 * eval's own deps injected: the dev server as the inference proxy, sims and
 * stubs as the tool server, and fixture snapshots as the editor state.
 *
 * Every run is timed off the loop's own hooks: the gate, each LLM round and
 * its first visible delta, and each tool serve. Retries happen inside the
 * transport and are invisible here, so latency numbers are the turn as the
 * user experiences it.
