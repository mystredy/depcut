        I built Donkey Cut because I wanted a video editor that was simple and
        open source.

              My favorite feature is Edit with Chat. Instead of clicking
              through menus, I can just tell the editor what I want, and it
              does it for me.

            <Text className="text-[15px] leading-relaxed">
              The editor will always have a free version, and the entire
              project is open source.
