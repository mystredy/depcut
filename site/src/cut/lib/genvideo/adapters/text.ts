  {"dialogue": string, "action": string, "characters": ["char:1"], "location": "loc:1", "framing": string, "intent": string, "approxSeconds": number}
]}
Rules:
- dialogue is the narration/spoken line for that beat (one or two sentences), action is what is shown on screen.
- logline is one sentence naming the whole video's story — the throughline every beat serves. intent is that beat's job in the story in a few words ("establish the world", "the turn", "the payoff", "raise the stakes"), so a shot rendered on its own still knows what it is FOR.
- Shape the beats as a story, not a list: open by establishing the world, turn on a small surprise or decision, and end on a payoff image that resolves it. Every beat must move the story from the one before it — never a repeat or a generic filler image any beat could use.
- framing is real camera language fit to the genre, varied beat to beat — wide establishing, close-up, insert of a telling detail (a sign, hands, an object), POV, follow shot, over-the-shoulder, aerial, macro, low angle, whatever the story calls for. Never the same framing twice in a row, and never treat this list as a quota.
- action carries continuity: name the wardrobe items and props the story repeats (the book, the earbuds, the bag) in every beat where they appear, so shots rendered independently still match.
- A shot cannot be trusted to render readable text: no signs, labels, charts, graphic overlays, or lettering beyond a single short word — information the viewer must read goes in the dialogue instead.
- Assign each recurring character a stable id "char:1", "char:2", … and each place a stable id "loc:1", "loc:2", …; every beat lists the ids it uses. A beat with no character uses []. A character introduced late (the reveal) is still a stable id from its first beat.
- Keep the whole thing near the requested length; each beat is about 4–8 seconds of narration.
- style is a short reusable look for the whole video (medium, lighting, palette, mood), described by its visual traits — never a real brand, franchise, show, or artist name, even one the brief uses (a generator rejects trademarked names).`;

Rules:
- start/end are SECONDS on the timeline; the shots must run in order and cover the whole duration with no gaps.
- Each shot is 2–8 seconds and depicts the concrete subject of the words heard across it. Cut a new shot at EVERY topic the narration touches — a two-second mention gets its own two-second shot, and the setting moves with the story (school, a strawberry patch, a pool); one backdrop must never absorb several ideas.
- Write action like a director's shot description, detailed enough to render the right moment without hearing the audio: who is on screen and their look, the specific activity mid-motion, the surroundings, and the camera's move.
- action is what the camera sees, never editing language: no "cut to", "transition", "fade", "montage" — the editor adds those between shots later.
- The brief, when given, is the source of truth for who speaks and who appears; the transcript is machine transcription that times the words and may mishear some — trust the brief over an odd transcription.
- framing is real camera language, varied shot to shot — wide establishing, close-up, insert of a telling detail, POV, follow shot — and action repeats the wardrobe and props that recur, so independently rendered shots still match.
- A shot cannot be trusted to render readable text: no signs, labels, charts, lists, or lettering beyond a single short word — the viewer already hears the information in the narration.
- Assign stable ids: characters "char:1"…, locations "loc:1"…, reused across shots for continuity. A shot with no character uses [].`;

Reply with JSON only:
{"style": string, "negative": string, "characters": [{"id": "char:1", "name": string, "description": string}], "locations": [{"id": "loc:1", "name": string, "description": string}]}
Rules:
- style is one reusable paragraph every shot carries: medium, lighting, palette, camera, mood. Name the medium first and unambiguously — it is the instruction renders most often break. When reference images are attached, derive this wording from what they actually show: name their exact technique (linework, shading, color finish) so words and pixels agree. Pin the palette with precise color words ("flat marigold yellow", "warm cream skin, no gradient") — every shot is drawn independently, and only an exact name keeps a color the same across them.
- Reference images set the LOOK. A reference that is itself a character design — a turnaround sheet, or a single full-body character on a plain background — also sets a cast member's DESIGN: when the brief gives that character no appearance of its own, describe the cast member as exactly the pictured character (hair, face, eyewear, outfit, precise colors). Any other reference's people, characters, and creatures join the cast only when the brief asks for them; otherwise design the cast from the brief and describe them in the reference's technique, never as the pictured characters.
- negative is a short comma-separated list of what must never appear in this look: the wrong medium's tells. For a hand-drawn 2D look: "photorealistic rendering, live-action footage, 3D CGI, realistic skin texture, photographic lighting". For live-action: "cartoon rendering, cel shading, illustration". Tells only — subjects and story stay out.
- Return one entry per id you are asked to define, using those exact ids. description is a concrete visual of that subject/place — appearance, one fixed wardrobe, and the props the story repeats (a bag, a book, earphones) — so every shot renders the same person carrying the same things. Name each garment's and prop's color with the same precise words the style paragraph uses, and repeat those words verbatim wherever the item appears.
- Never name a real brand, franchise, show, studio, or artist — not even one the brief names. A generator rejects a trademarked name, so translate any such reference into its concrete visual traits: linework, proportions, palette, shading, era. (e.g. a named 1990s TV cartoon → "hand-drawn 2D animation, thick black outlines, flat bright colors, exaggerated rounded features, yellow-toned skin, simple suburban backdrops".)`;
