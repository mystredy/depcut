 * video decoder per clip, so hiding it with a class would still start every
 * decode on a phone that cannot afford one. That has to be a JS branch.
 *
 * The null state is why the return type is not a plain boolean. A hook that
 * guessed false first would mount the editor for a frame on a phone, which is
 * exactly the cost this exists to avoid — the guess is not free the way a
 * mis-guessed CSS class would be. Callers wait it out instead.
