 * The coverage invariant and the frame/second boundary.
 *
 * Shots must tile the whole audio with no gaps and no overlaps: the first
 * starts at frame 0, the last ends at `durationFrames`, and every shot ends
 * exactly where the next begins. Because frames are integers this holds
 * exactly — the orchestrator re-asserts it after every mutation, and any model
 * output is run through `repairCoverage` before it is trusted. `repairCoverage`
 * is total: it never throws for any input (a model routinely returns
 * overlapping, nested, or out-of-order ranges), and it treats a zero-length
 * timeline as covered by zero shots.
 *
 * Seconds cross this boundary only through `frameToSec`/`secToFrame`, computed
 * once from the project fps. Everything else in the plan is frames.

 * trims the take to it (the dailies review picks which window survives). The
